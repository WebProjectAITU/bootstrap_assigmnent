                The Importance of Cooking
            </h1>
            <p>
                Food is one of the biggest aspects of a culture. Food has even made its way into pop culture. I mean, the only reason anyone gets on Facebook is to watch “Tasty” videos, and the cooking show “Chopped” is even on Netflix. It’s not often that we actually try out the demonstrated recipe or take advice from the real-life cooks that we watch. Students and young adults in general forget about the importance and the benefits of cooking for themselves.

                Why should you learn how to cook?
            </h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat stress. Cooking is fun way to relieve stress after a hard day of school or work. </li>
                <li>Expand your mind. Learning to cook will help you understand world cultures, customs and flavors. You will also learn life skills like eating healthy, budgeting your money, and cleaning. </li>
                <li>Save some cash. Cooking is less expensive than eating at restaurants, fast food joints and school cafeterias. Spending money on pre-packaged meals gets too expensive for a young person and families on a budget. </li>
                <li>Eat food you love. You have control over your menu and can pick exactly what you want to eat at every meal.</li>
                <li>Be more awesome. Cooking will boost your self-esteem. You will learn proper planning and preparation skills to see a task through from start to finish while contributing in a positive way to the health of your family and friends.</li>
